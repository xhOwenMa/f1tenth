# Image Dataset Notes

This folder contains all the dataset, including the images we collected as well as the images from previous groups

### Additional Notes

we resize images to 512x256 before annotations, and we train the model using resized images (in the original LaneNet paper, they trained their model using 512x256 images as well). The CSV files saved here are annotations on resized images. We believe that previous groups used 1280x720 images, which we think is inefficient.
